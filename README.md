# The Probabilistic G3 (PG3) Group-Finding Algorithm

This repository houses group-finding and related analysis code for the PG3 group-finding algorithm, an extension of the original G3 group-finding algorithm (Hutchens+2023 ApJ 956, 51) designed for use with incomplete, non-uniform, and flux-limited survey data. The PG3 algorithm builds on this methodology by incorporating photometric redshift uncertainties into group-finding, particularly to enable use in surveys dominated by photometric redshift measurements.
